						<!-- Interest in IT -->
							<article id="work">
								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/servers.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>What is your interest in IT? </b>I’m interested in how IT is constantly evolving. Although the progress of IT back in the day may have been extremely slow nowadays things are upgrading faster than ever and I want to work in an environment that reflects just that. I’d constantly be learning new things and I’d never have a stale day at work. Alongside this I enjoy figuring out how things work which is why I’m very interested in the programming aspect of IT.</div>
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>When did your interest in IT start?</b> Back when I was in primary school, IT was always my favourite class. Since then I've just always had an interest in it. </div>
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? </b>I wanted my own laptop since my brother had just started High School and got his own but no one wanted to give me one. Why did a primary school student need one anyway? Even though no one decided to get a laptop eventually my uncle found one of his old work laptops and let me keep it. It was that moment then that REALLY sparked my love for IT. I mean like, I had always liked computer class in primary school but that old laptop was what really sold it for me. It had so many things wrong with it that I was constantly researching and diagnosing it. Turns out I liked how I could learn new things about the physical laptop I was holding and what it was capable of.</div>
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </b>My brother also went here for his Associate’s Degree and told me that it was the best place to go for anything IT related. I had also attended the open days and really liked what I saw. Alongside this, I was at RMIT last year for my High School classes so I was already a bit familiar with the layout. You've also got those cool rocking chairs on that one floor which has become my new favourite place to work at.</div>
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies? </b>Lots of different types of IT-related things. Almost like a bit of everything? Of course I’ll major in an area that interests me the most but the Bachelor of Information Technology is, in my opinion, extremely broad and has the first year covering all different aspects of IT. I like this approach though as it allows people to experience everything before having them decide what they want to be an experts in.</div>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/tokyo.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><a href = "https://www.daijob.com/en/jobs/detail/778828">My Ideal Job</a>
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>Why is this position appealing?</b> This job advertisement is for an entry-level Developer position for someone who is experienced in either C++, Java or Javascript. The job is based in Japan and will require the successful applicant to either already be living in Japan or willing to move there under a working visa. Knowledge of the Japanese language is not required but will be highly preferred. This position is appealing to me because it’s literally exactly what I’ve been dreaming of. A coding position, located in Japan with the promise of a working visa. And they’re open to hiring recent graduates! Alongside this, they say that knowledge of the Japanese language is not required but I would love to continue studying my Japanese and what better place to learn than Japan itself.
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>What are the required skills, qualifications and experience for this position?</b> Business level English, preferably some knowledge of the Japanese language and experience in either C++ on Linux, Java, Javascript or C# (back end).
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>What skills, qualifications and experience do you currently have?</b> Business level English, little knowledge of the Japanese language and extremely little experience in Java.
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>What is your plan in obtaining the required skills, qualifications and experience required for this position?</b> Constantly practice and keep up to date with my Japanese studies and find out which programming language interests me the most out of the ones required for the job. Also gain some knowledge with the Linux OS in preparation for this and future jobs. Work towards majoring in programming/developing specifically to make me look more appealing as a candidate. I originally hoped to major in programming so this makes working to achieve that required skill a lot easier.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Personal Profile</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/campaigner.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>Results from an online Myers-Briggs test. </b>I am an ENFP (Campaigner). The campaigner personality is a true free spirit. They are often the life of the party, but unlike types in the Explorer Role group, Campaigners are less interested in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in enjoying the social and emotional connections they make with others. Charming, independent, energetic and compassionate, the 7% of the population that they comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd. Campaigners are fiercely independent, and much more than stability and security, they crave creativity and freedom.</div>
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>Results from an online learning style test. </b>I am a Visual learner. Visual learners are often neat and clean. We often close our eyes to visualize or remember something and will find something to watch if we are bored. We may have difficulty with spoken instructions and may also be easily distracted by sounds. We are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that are rich in imagery.</div>
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>Results from a Big Five Personality test. </b>The Big Five assessment measures your scores on five major dimensions of personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (abbreviated as OCEAN).</div>
								<div style="page-break-after: always;">Here was my test result:</div>
								<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
								<div style="page-break-after: always;"><p style="text-align:center;">O: 85%<br>C: 54%<br>E: 71%<br>A: 81%<br>N: 33%<br></p></div>
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;">What this means is I have a highly creative and imaginative way of thinking and I often see connections that others do not. I'm uninterested in the dull facts of a situation and prefer to interpret its meaning and implications. I might come up with an unusual idea or two but I'm open to everything and love envisioning alternate realities as well as possibilities for the future.
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>What do the results of all of these tests mean for you?</b> These test results tell me I like to be around others and enjoy being able to be creative with my work. I highly agree with this. I'd rather be able to do my own thing when it comes to work and have freedom in how I approach things compared to having to doing everything by the book. Alongside this, since I am a visual learner it means that I would rather get my instructions in a more creative way compared to someone telling me what to do. Maybe if I received my instructions through a document then I might have less trouble with interpreting it compared to a spoken instruction.
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b> Based off of my results, I don’t believe this would really affect my behaviour in a team. Being around people is something I’ve always highly enjoyed and I love working with others. Plus, because I'm so open I won't instantly turn down any of my teammates ideas and instead be open to anything they suggest.
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b> Possibly only when it comes to the type of work we’re doing and how instructions are going to be distributed. If the work is very mundane and doesn’t have a lot of room for creative input then I might not perform as well. Also, if I receive a spoken instruction from a teammate then I might end up asking a lot of follow-up questions.</div></p>
								<div style="page-break-after: always;"><p style="text-align:center;">Hopefully you don't judge me too much ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p></div>

							<article id="idea">
								<h2 class="major">Project Ideas - 1</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/idea1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>Project Idea:</b> Developing a game using software such as the Unity game engine or RPG Maker.
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>Overview:</b> An interesting idea I would like to pursue is creating a video game in a software such as Unity or even RPG Maker. If Unity, it would probably be something generic like a third-person game where you fight enemies but I would add my own twist to it through extremely unusual weapons, armor, level design, color-use, sound and enemies. Like, EXTREMELY unusual. There might even be a fantasy-like element to the game through the use of magic. Or maybe only all weapons. If made in RPG Maker however, I’d make it a classic save the prisoner game but have a big plot twist at the end :”) Something like the prisoner isn’t who you thought they were all along or maybe that you were the prisoner all along!
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>Motivation:</b> I think this project will be interesting because it’s going to be different. Sure, you might have heard that a million times before but I would love to be able to make something REALLY out of the ordinary. I wouldn’t follow the “norm” except for when it comes to fundamentals (press spacebar to jump) and I’d have complete freedom in how I want to approach things. Although people don’t really like change, being able to be completely free with my project will make me proud of it no matter what happens. However, if I were to use RPG Maker, I would take heavy influence from the Legend of Zelda series (specifically the Toon Link series) as they have the “save the princess” formula down pat. I have always been a fan of this series and making a game that could relate to that series would be great. As for the usefulness of my idea, I’m sure someone out there in the world would enjoy my game. Or maybe my game will end with a big life lesson and completely wow all the players as the credits roll?
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>Description:</b> Regarding my Unity game idea, I’d give my game a really aesthetic name. Everything sounds cooler that way. I’d probably call it “Silent Sweetheart” or “Sumire” which means violet in Japanese. Yes yes very aesthetic. The plot would most likely be based around randomly generated dungeon floors with the last boss after ten or so floors. I’m not sure if there will be a story of it it’ll just be about clearing levels. Combat will follow the fundamentals of most third-person games. This means the game will play as if it was like Dark Souls. Even though lots of games are being made with the same gameplay elements as Dark Souls, the Dark Souls element is relatively new and isn’t too burnt out yet. Because of this, there’ll be a stamina bar as well as a health bar. 
								Weapons won’t be limited to swords. You’d have anything you can see at your disposal. This included picking up items (such as a barrel) to using a whip as a weapon. The art style would probably be low-poly with pastel colours. Although I mentioned dungeon floors earlier, every floor would be different. One floor might be your generic dungeon room but the next might have you outside in an open-world area. The main objective for each room will still be to make it to the end. I think the game might be based around a tower which you climb up with each “floor” of the tower being a new world.
								Replayability will be a big part of my game with randomly generated dungeons. That way, players would be able to replay over and over and experience at least one thing new every time. 
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;">As for my RPG Maker game idea, I’d take a lot of ideas from The Legend of Zelda. Namely how you had to travel to different islands/areas by a literal boat or “Spirit Train”. I remember being very fond of this type of gameplay because not only did each new area or island have heaps to do but your way of arriving at those destinations was only limited by your imagination. The game has lots of opportunities for open-world gameplay, allowing you to fish in the sea or make small stops at small towns with your train. I want to somehow emulate this type of freedom in my own type of game. I believe an airship with the ability to travel to different parts of the country would allow my players to have heaps of freedom in where they want to go. Whether it be to another major city or to a small fishing town on the edge of the sea. I might follow the Legend of Zelda formula of having to go to certain areas to obtain the correct items to assist in beating the last boss or I might make it very open world with RPG-levelling elements and questing The RPG Maker battle system only allows for turn-based combat and 2D gameplay so a lot of the game is experienced through text and visuals. Replayability probably won’t be as big a part in my RPG Maker due to the limitations of text. Reading the same text over and over gets stale extremely fast. I could make up for this with a longer storyline or lots of side quests, etc.

								<h2 class="major">Project Ideas - 2</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/idea2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>Tools and Technologies:</b> I would require the use of the Unity game engine, a mediocre gaming computer (we’re talking probably an i3 CPU, 8GB RAM, at least 128GB storage and an average/below-average graphics card. We’re not remaking Crysis here. Just making a fun little game. Although the better the hardware, the more opportunities to work with..) I’d also need the basics like a computer monitor, headset, mouse and keyboard, etc. 
								The software ‘Blender’ would be used for 3D assets and for sound design I would ask my friend (a music producer) for some assistance. Some open-source tools I would consider using is Open Match (only if I wanted to implement multiplayer into my game) and possibly Super Character Controller. Open Match is an open-source matchmaking system created by Google and Unity together and Super Character Controller is a character controller solution that incorporates basic collison and pushback mechanics among other things. Although SCC is no longer updated, it would be a great starting place for character movement.
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>Drawbacks and Obstacles:</b> A major drawback would be my experience with this sort of project. Being my first ever game, it would probably end up super clunky with lots of bugs and glitches. Alongside this, another drawback would be my storytelling skills. I can’t put anything I think of in my mind to paper so the game may not have a story.. A main obstacle would be time. I would have to learn from scratch how to use Unity and Blender among other things which could end up taking a majority of my project time up. Ways around both of this are limited. Constant testing and debugging could eliminate a lot of the bugs but when it comes to learning how the software works I’d just have to be extremely persistent and believe in my abilities.
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>Skills Required:</b> I’d probably use a lot of online guides to figure out how Unity and Blender work among other things like graphics-tweaking and basic sound design. 
								The shaders and game itself will have to be hard-coded through Unity also. I don’t think there will be too much trouble with this consider there are heaps of guides online but nothing works perfectly the first time so there’ll be a lot of trial and error involved. External special hardware might include premade assets through the Unity store for things I wouldn’t really be able to create in Blender. Using pre-made assets would be a last resort however because it’s not something created by me. A majority of what I need to complete this project will be learnt through online guides and research. 
								<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><b>Outcome:</b> If the project is successful then I will have created my first ever video game! A strange third-person monster fighting game. My original problem of not having knowledge with any of the software will have been solved as I would now know the basics when it comes to making a video game. I’ll forever be knowledgeable in the process of games development and programming.
